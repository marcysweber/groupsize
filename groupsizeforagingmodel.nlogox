; This is the "base model" code, where we will build the simplest working primate group model
; I expect to then copy this code into new files, where the additional submodels can be added on piecemeal
; Contributors to this file are Marcy Ekanayake-Weber, Deanna Cunha, and Chris O'Connor-Coates
;
; this file also now includes simple group recognition. Paige Olsen will be working
